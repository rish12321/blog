TYPES OF DRONES :

1. Basic beginner quadcopter- a basic rig that is comparitively easier to setup and meant for leisure flying.
Medium sized (300-500 size), most common being the DJI F450 platform.


2. Advanced quadcopter- a step up from the beginner quadcopter, more powerful with lower kv motors, a slightly bigger frame (such as a tarot 650, or a TBS discovery).
Can be used for leisure flying, but the bigger size allows it to easily carry a 2 or 3 axis gimbal and an actioncamera such as the Sjcam , yicam , etc.
Can have a live fpv feed as well, to get the right footage.


3. FPV racer- Relatively new, very agile quadcopters meant for either freestyle or as the name suggests, fpv racing. 
Typically includes high kv motors 2300-2700kv, 3-4s lipo batteries, and are really compact and a small frame (220 size).
A live fpv (first-person-view) setup allows the pilot who typically wears goggles to get ultra low latency feed and fly fast as if in the pilot seat.


4. Aerial Photography rig- these are high end rigs that can be custom built and can carry a heavy payload, with very low kv motors 3-400kv.
This is needed to be able to carry the heavy camera and gimbal needed for professional aerial photography.


5. Other custom rigs- this may be used for aerial mapping, or for something like agriculture.
