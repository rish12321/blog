WHAT IS A DRONE

A drone, also known as a UAV (Unmanned aerial vehicle) is an aircraft piloted by remote control or onboard computers. It may be a multicopter -which includes bicopter, tricopter, quadcopter, hexacopter, or even an octacopter which has 8 propellors; or a drone may also refer to fixed wing aircraft.
A quadcopter is the most popular, since the 4 propellor configuration makes it stable and simple enough, compared to lets say a bicopter or a tricopter, while being cheaper than the extremely stable hexacopters or octacopters. Here on, drone in this forum refers to multicopters, and in specific, quadcopter ( 4 motor/propellor sets)



PARTS

It consists of the following parts-
1. Frame- This is the basic structure, where the motors,ESCs are mounted, and connected to the flight controller in the centre of the aforementioned frame. Due to the stress from usage- is made of rigid plastic or carbon fibre.
2. Motors (2 for a bicopter, 3 for a tricopter, 4 for a quadcopter, and so on)- These receive input signal and power from the esc, and spin the propellors to generate thrust. Usually, brushless outrunner motors are used.
3. ESC or an electronic speed controller- These receive signals from the flight controller and use it to control the motor. Each motor has its individual ESC.
4. Fc (	Flight controller)- This is the brain of the quadcopter. Embedded with microprocessors, gyro, barometer , etc- and it may even have a gps attached to it- the flight controller keeps the drone stable by controlling the esc.
5. Propellor- Connected to the motor- it generates thrust on spinning. Usually Clockwise and anti/ counter clockwise propellors are alternated on the drone. Their length and pitch vary, and these affect the thrust generated and amps drawn. 
6. Battery (usually a lithium polymer (Li-Po) )- This provides the required juice to run the quadcopter or drone
7. Radio 2.4GHz (transmitter & receiver)- This is what you use to control the drone.



HOW DOES IT WORK

The battery powers the ESCs. The FC (flight controller) is usually fed power through the ESCs, or is just directly connected to the pdb (power distribution board)- and the receiver is rigged to the FC.
The transmitter is used to control the drone, which navigates by lowering relative speed of the propellor (with respect to the other propellors) -in the direction the drone needs to move. Due to the drone inherently being instable, a flight controller is (which has multiple microprocessors and gyros and other sensors on it) which makes the esc continuously adjust motor speed to keep the drone stable
How the drone navigates up or down- the propellors speed up equally to gain altitude or slow down to lose some. They vary speed unequally to move in a particular direction- by making the quadcopter first tilt in that direction.



WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS | TYPES OF DRONES

Drones come in various configurations and sizes, and can be used for various
applications- leisure flying - which may also have a camera and an fpv setup to get you some good footage, intermediate drones with some more power, aerial photography rigs for professionals, aerial mapping for projects and for agricultural purposes- dropping seeds, spraying of insecticides and fertilisers, etc.




HOW TO BUILD A BASIC DRONE

1. Parts selection
2. Assembly
3. Radio and flight controller setup
4. Testing
5. Gimbal and action camera setup (optional)
6. FPV SETUP FOR DRONE (optional)




CURRENT INDIAN DRONE REGULATIONS

Finally, flying drones is legal in India, although the regulations having a few flaws, leave much to be desired, as is expected from the people that made these, them being a bunch of cunts. Also, with the advent of multicopters, it has ruined it for the traditional aeromodellers, now with even these model radio control planes being categorised as drones, although they hardly have the maneuverability or payload carrying capacity as compared to a similar weighing multicopter.
Enough rant. 
Herego the regulations, with some simplification (where drone refers both to multicopters and model hobby rc planes, at least for the time being).

Drones are categorised based on their weight into four categories- 
1. Nano (upto 250g)
2. Micro (>Nano and upto 2kg)
3. Small (>Micro and upto 25kg)
4. Medium (>Small and upto 150 kg)
5. Large (>150kg)
	
Permits needed- 
1. Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP)- Basically what you need to apply for, if you want to control an aircraft. One time per pilot, and has a fee of INR 25000 associated with it.
2. Unique Identification Number (UIN)- You need one of these for each drone, ergo,  RPA (Remotely Piloted Aircraft) you own and intend to fly. Here’s where the process gets tricky, since most of the requirements are things not even present in advanced multicopters, let alone hobby grade ones, and let’s not even begin to discuss how tough these are to implement on model rc airlines, which are flown with Line of Sight (LOS) anyway.
3. Importing- for this, an Equipment Type Approval(ETA) from the Wireless Planning & Coordination wing (WPC) , Department of Telecommunications, Government of India is needed, and the process being complicated, isn’t explained here, but do give the PDF attached a thorough read.

Requirements for issue of Unique Identification Number (UIN)
1. Be an Indian citizen, or
A company or a body corporate provided that- it is registered and has its principal place of business within India, its chairman and 2/3’ds of directors are citizens of India, and its substantial ownership and effective control is vested in Indian nationals.
2. Contact details of owner/ lessee with CIN, GSTIN and Pan Card.
3. Specification of RPAS
4. Weight of compatible payload and maximum payload carrying capacity.
5. Manufacturer’s maintenance guidelines for RPA
6. Manufacturer’s Certificate of compliance for NPNT.
7. ETA from WPC, Department of Telecommunications, for RPA operating in delicensed frequency bands. Typically rc’s use 2.4 Ghz and 5.8 Ghz (for video.)
8. Nano category is exempted from obtaining a UIN.  

Requirements for issue of Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP)
1. Exemptions- Nano category operating below 50 feet in uncontrolled airspace/ enclosed premises; micro category operating below 200 feet (however user must intimate to local police)
2. Details of remote pilots along with security clearance of MHA or self-attested copies of 2 out of the following- Passport, Driving license or Aadhar card and copies of training records,
3. Insurance details
4. Security programme as approved by BCAS.
The UAOP is valid for a period of 5 years. It can’t be transferred.

Other topics covered in the attached PDF- Security/Safety requirements, remote pilot training requirements,RPAS maintenance requirements, Equipment requirements, Operating requirements & restrictions, General Requirements, Insurance. 

To conclude, its a fuck all process. People allegedly fly and get out of situations by allegedly bribing cops, which is allegedly much easier than going through the painstaking process, if you’re just a hobbyist.




OUR SERVICES

You want it, we’ll build it. Most reasonable pricing, no fucking you over.
Be it an aerial photography rig, or something for your kid to fly- trust us, if you do buy one for your kid, you’ll want to buy one for your kid again. Because the first one, you’ll be the one flying it half the time.
Can also build you your fpv racing rig, or you your drone that can carry heavy payload- be it an expensive camera and gimbal rig, or a pesticide sprayer for that agricultural land.
