Your tracking may show various different statuses, and in this section we try to explain what each of these mean-
1. Receive item at office of exchange (Inb)- the parcel has reached India and will go through customs clearance next. Importing an item is a game of patience, customs love to take their time. Give them that, and chill.
2. Send item to customs (Inb)- 
3.  Record item customs information (Inb) Retention reason : Other- Your parcel is going through clearance. WAIT. Importing an item is a game of patience, customs love to take their time. Give them that, and chill. IF theres no update, call your customs office, they won’t answer. Then google the address and go there. They might send you a letter but I wouldn’t wait for it. Then, see what they ask you for. If its just duty, cool. If they ask you for documents, go through the topic “The documents you may be asked for: (And how to get them or their alternatives)”

The documents you may be asked for: 
(And how to get them or their alternatives)

1.  Invoice and certificate of origin - Just provide them with the original invoice (or allegedly undervalue it)
2.  Copy of I.E.C - You don’t need an IEC for personal import for personal use. The IEC to be used for personal use imports is 0100000053.
3.  Purpose of importation- Just draft a letter to the commissioner of customs, of your local customs office, stating what the item is and that it is for personal use. The letter should bear the tracking number, and signed by you. If you’re a student, get your Principal to write a letter declaring the same as for educational purposes.
4.  Purchase receipt- Same as the invoice.
5. ETA from WPC- This is needed to make sure your radio equipment adheres to the standards. Tough to get. How to go about it? Check, if your particular item is already type approved. Theres a list of type approved items, linked. If you can’t get this, get a screenshot of the product specifications where it mentions the frequency. Also, a lot of the frequencies are delicensed (24Ghz, 5.8Ghz, etc). Below linked are a few of the notices from WPC stating that- and you can google and find the same for your required frequency as well, if I haven’t already linked the same).  
6. NOC from DGCA- Tough to get, just use the same notice as mentioned above.  If you’re a student, get your Principal to write a letter declaring the same as for educational purposes.
7. Xerox of PAN Card- Self explanatory.


List of stuff that WILL get stuck.
(Try to avoid ordering them, but if you already have ordered and its stuck, go through the previous topic “The documents you may be asked for:” for guidance.)
1. Radios (transmitter/receiver)
2. Assembled drones
3. Video transmitter/ receiver
4. Batteries


Customs TIPS:
1. Allegedly, duty can be allegedly avoided by allegedly asking the seller to under declare value, especially when the parcel comes through post.
2. Don’t order radios or drones internationally, approx 80% of the times IT WILL get stuck. Being someone that have had their radios, multiple drones and rc planes cleared through customs, if you have already ordered and its stuck, go through the previous topic “The documents you may be asked for:” for guidance.
3. It is okay to oder drone parts though, as long as the parts look generic.
4. Ordering batteries internationally is risky, try to find something locally.


How to respond to their letter:
Go through my topics - “The documents you may be asked for: “ and get the required documents ready, and don’t mail them, just go down to the customs office with the same. Always a good idea to talk to them nicely, especially the staff - often they can get your item cleared, allegedly for a small “fee”- do meet with the commissioner first though and see if it can get cleared the right way.
